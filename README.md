## Workflow

* File an issue to discuss the topic and build consensus.
* Once consensus has been reached, the issue author should create a pull 
  request that summarises the discussion in the appropriate `.md` file,
  and request review from all folks who participated the issue discussion.
* Once all participants have accepted the PR, the original author merges.
