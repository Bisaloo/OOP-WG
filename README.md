# Object-oriented Programming Working Group

* [Initial proposal](proposal/proposal.org)
* [Requirements brainstorming](spec/requirements.md)
* [Minutes](minutes/)
* [Code](R/) (this repository is an R package)

## Workflow

* File an issue to discuss the topic and build consensus.
* Once consensus has been reached, the issue author should create a pull 
  request that summarises the discussion in the appropriate `.md` file,
  and request review from all folks who participated the issue discussion.
* Once all participants have accepted the PR, the original author merges.
